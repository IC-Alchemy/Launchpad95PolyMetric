# Technical Specification: Looping Clip Mode Plan

## Overview

A new user mode for Launchpad95, accessed by pressing the **User 1** button 3 times (cycling through instrument → device → looping clip). The mode provides a multi-track visual clip looper using the full 8×8 pad matrix, allowing users to set loop start/end points for up to 4 tracks (16 pads each) with a toggle to 8 tracks (8 pads each).

**Clip support:** Both audio clips and MIDI clips. The mode operates on `clip.loop_start` / `clip.loop_end` / `clip.start_marker` / `clip.end_marker` properties. For MIDI clips, it also repositions notes to stay within the clip loop range when loop endpoints change.

## Architecture

### New Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `LoopingClipModeComponent.py` | Top-level `CompoundComponent` — owns the matrix, tracks, OSD, side/top button assignments |

### Modified Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `Settings.py` | Add `"looping clip"` to `USER_MODES_1` |
| `MainSelectorComponent.py` | Instantiate `LoopingClipModeComponent`, add `_setup_looping_clip_mode()`, add `getSkinName` mapping, update `_setup_sub_mode` |
| `SkinMK2.py` | Add `LoopingClipMode` color class |

---

## Mode Selection

Pressing **User 1** cycles through `USER_MODES_1` sub-modes:

```
press 1 → instrument
press 2 → device  
press 3 → looping clip   ← NEW
press 4 → instrument (wraps)
```

`Settings.USER_MODES_1` becomes:

```python
USER_MODES_1 = [
    "instrument",
    "device",
    "looping clip"
]
```

`MainSelectorComponent._setup_sub_mode` gains a new branch for `"looping clip"`.

`MainSelectorComponent.getSkinName` gains: `"looping clip" → "LoopingClipMode"`.

## Matrix Layout

### 4-Track Mode (default)
Full 8×8 grid divided into 4 horizontal lanes of 16 pads each:

```
Row 0-1 → Track 0  (16 pads = columns 0-7 × rows 0-1)
Row 2-3 → Track 1  (16 pads)
Row 4-5 → Track 2  (16 pads)
Row 6-7 → Track 3  (16 pads)
```

Each pad represents `1/16` of the clip's loop length when quantization is set to a 16-step constraint.

### 8-Track Mode (toggled)
Full 8×8 grid divided into 8 horizontal lanes of 8 pads each:

```
Row 0 → Track 0  (8 pads = columns 0-7)
Row 1 → Track 1  (8 pads)
...
Row 7 → Track 7  (8 pads)
```

Each pad represents `1/8` of the clip's loop length when quantization is set to an 8-step constraint.

### Quantization Rule

- **4-track mode:** The clip's `loop_end - loop_start` is constrained to multiples of 16 steps. Setting a loop range snaps endpoints to 1/16 boundaries.
- **8-track mode:** The clip's `loop_end - loop_start` is constrained to multiples of 8 steps. Setting a loop range snaps endpoints to 1/8 boundaries.

The length constraint is enforced when setting loop positions: the loop length `(end - start)` must be evenly divisible by the mode's step count (16 or 8).

---

## Interaction Model

### Two-Pad Loop Selection
Hold two pads within the same track's row(s) at the same time. Their positions map to time offsets within the clip:

```
4-track:  offset = (column * 2 + sub_row) * (clip_loop_length / 16)
8-track:  offset = column * (clip_loop_length / 8)
```

The first held pad is shown as the **pending loop start**. When the second pad is pressed while the first is still held, the loop range is set between the two pads. Holding the first and last pad together restores the full clip span.


### Single-Pad Tap
A single pad tap does not create a loop. Releasing a tapped pad inside the current loop jumps playback to that segment and plays from there.

If the clip is already playing, the jump happens immediately within the running loop. If the clip is stopped, the clip is launched first and the launch waits for the currently selected launch quantization before the playback jump is applied.

Taps outside the current loop do not change the loop range.

### Visual States

| State | Color |
|-------|-------|
| Empty track (no clip) | `DefaultButton.Disabled` (off) |
| Pad outside loop range | `LoopingClipMode.PadOff` (dim) |
| Pad inside loop range | `LoopingClipMode.PadInLoop` |
| Pad at loop start boundary | `LoopingClipMode.PadStart` (bright) |
| Pad at loop end boundary | `LoopingClipMode.PadEnd` (bright) |
| Playhead on pad | `LoopingClipMode.Playing` (pulse) |
| Pending start select (held) | `LoopingClipMode.PadSelected` (blink) |

## Track Management

### Track Selection
The mode operates on the first N tracks visible in Ableton Live's session, starting from a configurable track offset (using nav buttons to bank).

- **4-track mode:** Shows tracks `offset` through `offset + 3`
- **8-track mode:** Shows tracks `offset` through `offset + 7`

Navigation buttons (top buttons 0/1 or 2/3) scroll the track offset by 4 in 4-track mode, or by 8 in 8-track mode.

### Clip Detection
For each track, if that track has a clip slot at the currently selected scene:
- If the clip exists and is playing, the clip reference is stored and its loop properties are read.
- If no clip exists or the slot is empty, the track row(s) show as disabled.

### Audio vs MIDI
- **Audio clips:** `loop_start` / `loop_end` / `start_marker` / `end_marker` are set directly.
- **MIDI clips:** Same loop properties are set. Additionally, existing MIDI notes that fall outside the new loop range are either trimmed or the clip content is repositioned (stretch/trim behavior TBD — simplest approach: notes outside the new loop range are deleted to prevent orphaned events).

---

## Toggle: 4-Track ↔ 8-Track

A side button toggles the view between 4-track and 8-track configurations.

**Proposed button:** Side button 1 (topmost side button, same position as "Vol" in mixer mode).

- Tap to toggle between 4-track and 8-track.
- The OSD shows the current mode: `"Looper 4-Trk"` or `"Looper 8-Trk"`.
- Toggling resets the track layout and re-renders the grid.
- Loop positions are preserved per track; the visual representation changes but the clip data is not modified.

## Color Definitions (SkinMK2.py)

```python
class LoopingClipMode:
    PadOff = Rgb.DARK_GREY        # Pad representing time outside loop range
    PadInLoop = Rgb.BLUE_THIRD    # Pad inside loop range (dim)
    PadStart = Rgb.GREEN          # Pad at loop start boundary
    PadEnd = Rgb.RED              # Pad at loop end boundary
    Playing = Rgb.GREEN_PULSE     # Playhead position
    PadSelected = Rgb.AMBER_BLINK # Pending start selection (held)
    TrackEmpty = Rgb.BLACK        # No clip on this track's pads
```

Mode button tint:
```python
class Mode:
    class LoopingClipMode:
        On = Rgb.RED
        Off = Rgb.RED_THIRD
```

---

## Implementation Order

1. **Settings.py** — Add `"looping clip"` to `USER_MODES_1`
2. **SkinMK2.py** — Add `LoopingClipMode` and `Mode.LoopingClipMode` color classes
3. **LoopingClipModeComponent.py** — Create the new component with:
   - Constructor: register matrix listener, side button listeners, initialize track state
   - `set_enabled()`: enable/disable, register/deregister Live listeners
   - `update()`: poll clip states, render grid
   - `_matrix_value()`: handle simultaneous two-pad loop selection and single-pad jump playback
   - `_toggle_track_mode()`: 4-track ↔ 8-track
   - `_render_grid()`: LED output with caching
   - `_set_clip_loop_range()`: quantized loop position update
   - Track navigation and clip listeners
4. **MainSelectorComponent.py** — Wire the new component:
   - Import `LoopingClipModeComponent`
   - Instantiate in `__init__()`
   - Add `_setup_looping_clip_mode()` setup method
   - Add `"looping clip"` branch in `_setup_sub_mode()`
   - Add `"looping clip" → "LoopingClipMode"` in `getSkinName()`
   - Handle mode button update in `_update_mode_buttons()`
   - Handle channel in `channel_for_current_mode()`

---

## Edge Cases & Constraints

- **No clip on a track:** Track pads show `TrackEmpty`. Pressing a pad on an empty track does nothing.
- **Clip is not playing:** Loop positions can still be edited. Playhead indicator is hidden.
- **MIDI clip with notes outside new loop range:** Notes outside the new `[loop_start, loop_end]` range are deleted from the clip to keep the clip clean. Time values of remaining notes are preserved relative to loop_start.
- **Double-press timing:** Uses a 250ms window (same as existing `LoopSelectorComponent`).
- **Track banking boundaries:** Cannot scroll past `len(song().tracks)`. Nav button LEDs reflect scrollability.
- **Component cleanup on mode exit:** `set_enabled(False)` deregisters all Live listeners and turns off all LEDs.
